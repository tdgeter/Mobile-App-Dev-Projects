# Dice Roll Application

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>This project was created so that we could experiment in Android Studio, and practice some of the things we learned about Kotlin. With the aid of a tutorial, we were instructed to create a similar dice app with the added challenge of recreating it with Jetpack Compose, as well as adding our own additional feature.</p>

## Built With

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Android Studio


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your device. From there, open Android studio and go to the location of the repo. Open the app you wish to take a look at by selecting it within Android studio, and it will configure for you. From there you can operate the application in an emulator or build an APK file from the source code. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<p> The application is simple, and just requires that you press the roll button to produce a random "roll" of the dice. The base implementation only included the image of the dice and the button. </p>

 </div>

<p> I chose to go with a "Previous Rolls" list for my additional feature. After this addition, the app could now keep a running list of all rolls made after starting the app. </p>

</div>


<!-- POTENTIAL FEATURES -->
## Potential Features

- Dice Selection: Select from different dice (D4, D6, etc.)
- Quantity of Dice: For example 1xD4, 2xD6
- Multi-Dice Rolls: 1xD4 with 2xD6 together.
