# To Do Application

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>This project was created so that we could experiment in Android Studio, and practice some of the things we learned about Kotlin. In addition, we were allowed to use the base build of the app given to us by our professor so that we could get exposure to the MVVM architecture.</p>

## Built With

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Android Studio


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your device. From there, open Android studio and go to the location of the repo. Open the folder correspoinding to the app you wish to take a look at by selecting it within Android studio, and it will configure for you. From there you can operate the application in an emulator or build an APK file from the source code. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<p> The application has a simple UI. To create a new to-do item, you must type a Task name and description into the text fields and then tap add: </p>
<div align="center">  <img width="344" height="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a9c27ac-ba71-4e67-9fd9-4948c70bb4a2" />
</div>

<p> I expanded on the app by adding the descripition attribute to each task item, and also added a "Date Added" line to each task. Along with this, I created a category selector that allows a user to select from a pre-set number of categories. The color of the to-do item will then change based on the category assigned to it. </p>
<div align="center"> <img width="337" height="673" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/891e75d4-8fe9-49b9-85d2-0c309fadf1c1" />
</div>


<!-- POTENTIAL FEATURES -->
