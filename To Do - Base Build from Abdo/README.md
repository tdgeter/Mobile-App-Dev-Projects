# To Do Application

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>This project was created so that we could experiment in Android Studio, and practice some of the things we learned about Kotlin. In addition, we were allowed to use the base build of the app given to us by our professor so that we could get exposure to the MVVM architecture.</p>

## Built With

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Android Studio


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your device. From there, open Android studio and go to the location of the repo. Open the app you wish to take a look at by selecting it within Android studio, and it will configure for you. From there you can operate the application in an emulator or build an APK file from the source code. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<p> The application has a simple UI. You just simply type into the text field the to do item you wish to add. </p>
<div align="center"> <img width="363" height="220" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473e9ce9-de12-4b2e-a54d-12dc746b36ca" />
 </div>

<p> I chose to make a few changes to the over all formating of the to do items by adding items like a date added tracker, as well as a description section that can be edited for each item. In addition, I added a category selection with some preset categories. When the category is changed, the background color of the item is changed.  </p>
